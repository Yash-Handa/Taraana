Taraana30 is a web scraper that calculates weekly Top 30 Bollywood Songs from various platforms:

- **Radio Mirchi** - [List](http://www.radiomirchi.com/more/mirchi-top-20/)
- **Gaana** - [Play List](https://gaana.com/playlist/gaana-dj-bollywood-top-50-1)
- **saavn** - [Play List](https://www.jiosaavn.com/featured/weekly-top-songs/8MT-LQlP35c_)
- **Hungama** - [Play List](https://www.hungama.com/playlists/bollywood-top-40/6532/)
- **Wynk** - [Play List](https://wynk.in/music/playlist/weekly-top-20-bollywood/bb_1491818945339)

The Web Scraper scrapes the above List/Play List for the data from various providers and save the data in the data folder : `./data/<date of previous week's saturday>/` more on `<date of previous week's saturday>` later

### Usage

The Web Scraper provides 2 main commands:

1. To get just top_30.csv and candidates.csv:

```shell
    $ python main.py
```

 Run the above command from the root of the folder to produce `top_30.csv` and `candidates.csv` files in the data folder: `./data/<date of previous week's saturday>/top_30.csv` and `/candidates.csv`

 2. To get all .csv files from the scraper:

 ```shell
    $ python main.py --all
 ```

Run the above command from the root of the folder to procude:

- `candidates.csv`
- `top_30.csv`
- `gaana.csv`
- `hungama.csv`
- `mirchi.csv`
- `saavn.csv`
- `wynk.csv`

in the `./data/<date of previous week's saturday>/` folder if it exist or create it then create the files

**`<date of previous week's saturday>`**: The folder naming system of the scraper uses the date of the previous Saturday to distinguish between two weeks. The date is in the formate: `DD-MM-YYYY`. (The week changes on `Sunday 00:00:00` i.e., even if the scrip is run on Saturday the folder name will be the date of previous Saturday)

Example:

```md
./
├── data
    ├── 22-06-2019
    │   ├── top_30.csv
    │   └── candidates.csv
    └── 29-06-2019
        ├── top_30.csv
        ├── candidates.csv
        ├── gaana.csv
        ├── hungama.csv
        ├── mirchi.csv
        ├── saavn.csv
        └── wynk.csv
```

### Installation

Currently the tool is only present as a GitHub repository and could be used from there only

1. Fork and Clone to your machine

2. Run the pipenv: `pipenv shell`

3. Run `pipenv install --ignore-pipfile` to install all dependencies to your machine. The main dependencies are:
   - beautifulsoup4
   - requests
   - lxml

### Technical Aspects

- Language: **Python v3.7.3**
- Scraping Module: **BeautifulSoup v4.7.1** with **lxml parser**
- I/O request Module: **requests v2.22.0**
- Misc: This project is a collection of 5 scrapers one for each plateform:
  - `radiomirchi.com`
  - `gaana.com`
  - `hungama.com`
  - `jiosaavn.com`
  - `wynk.in`

  To speed up the scraping process particularly the delay in various I/O requests for gathering the source code from various platforms **Multi-Threading** is used, 1 thread per scraper (i.e., thread pool of 5 threads)

 **Note**: The `data/22-06-2019` folder in the repository is just an example/sample folder with data just to see the output of the script. No `.csv` file should be saved with the scraper. If you want to disable this feature, then remove `*.csv` from `.gitignore` file

 ### Using as a Package

When using as a package import the `main` module and call the `taraana30()` function on it.

```py
from Taraana import main

# This function will just write the .csv files and will not return anything
main.taraana30()
```

the `taraana30()` takes 1 optional argument `all_files` which tells how many files to create
- `all_files=True`: this is same as passing `--all` argument to the script from terminal
- `all_files=False`: (*Default*) this is same as running the script without any argument

**Note**: The `taraana30()` function makes the `./data/<date of previous week's saturday>/` folder relative to the script it is called from (it uses the `os.getcwd()` function to find the current working directory and makes the `./data/<date of previous week's saturday>/` directory in it)
